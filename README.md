# 🏥 NFHS Health Insights: A Data Analyst’s Perspective

![NFHS Banner](https://github.com/harsh-bca/National-Family-Health-Survey-Analysis/blob/main/Assets/NFHS%20data%20analysis%20banner.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS)** to uncover meaningful insights about healthcare in India. It dives into topics like **infant mortality**, **vaccination coverage**, and even **data inconsistencies** within the government-published dataset.

As a data analyst, I took this opportunity to not just work with raw public health data but also to explore its real-life impact — especially for NGOs, researchers, and policy-makers.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

🔹 **Urban men** are 37% more overweight than rural counterparts.  
🔹 **Indian men** consume 23% more alcohol than women.  
🔹 **Around 75% of India’s population** still resides in rural areas — that’s nearly 3 times more than urban.  
🔹 **Uttar Pradesh** tops the chart for underweight men and women, with most from rural areas.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel** for performing basic arithmatic operation.
- **Power Query** for Data Profiling such as selecting necessary columns,modifying data types etc.
- **DAX** to create new measures which will further boost visualization.
- **Python:**  for analyzing dataset and finding correlation(`pandas`, `matplotlib`)
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and visual storytelling.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me:
- How to handle **public datasets** with missing or incorrect entries
- How to translate **data trends into real-world health implications**
- How to build visual stories for **non-technical stakeholders** using dashboards
- One key learning from this project was understanding how correlations observed in Python during data exploration may not always hold when visualized in tools like Power BI, especially after applying filters or slicers.

Initially, **I identified a potential correlation between overweight individuals and high sugar levels, and underweight individuals with very high sugar levels using Python**. However, after loading the dataset into Power BI and applying slicers like area type (rural vs. urban), **the correlation wasn't as strong or consistent**.

This experience taught me the importance of validating assumptions across different tools and perspectives, and how context (like geographic segmentation) can significantly influence data interpretation. **It highlighted the need to approach data analysis not just technically, but critically**.

## 🧾 How Can This Help You?

👥 **For NGOs or Health Sector Workers:**  
Use the Power BI dashboard or insights to highlight regional needs or present data in health campaigns.

🎓 **For Students or Analysts:**  
Study the notebook to learn how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world public datasets.

🧮 **For Recruiters or Employers:**  
This is a proof of my problem-solving ability, storytelling through data, and practical technical application.

⚠️ **Concerning Observation:**
 The NFHS dataset lacks data on sexual violence against men, which raises important questions about inclusivity and gender equality in health reporting. As data professionals, we must not only analyze but also advocate for comprehensive and balanced datasets that represent all demographics equally.
