# 🏥 NFHS Health Insights: A Data Analyst’s Perspective

![NFHS Banner](images/nfhs_banner.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS)** to uncover meaningful insights about healthcare in India. It dives into topics like **infant mortality**, **vaccination coverage**, and even **data inconsistencies** within the government-published dataset.

As a data analyst, I took this opportunity to not just work with raw public health data but also to explore its real-life impact — especially for NGOs, researchers, and policy-makers.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

🔹 **Urban men** are 37% more overweight than rural counterparts.  
🔹 **Indian men** consume 23% more alcohol than women.  
🔹 **Around 75% of India’s population** still resides in rural areas — that’s nearly 3 times more than urban.  
🔹 **Uttar Pradesh** tops the chart for underweight men and women, with most from rural areas.
